Our totally real client reached out saying their site is not working in a few different ways. First and foremost it doesn't match the mock-up they were provided, but even the page they were shown doesn't work as expected. Below are a few of the functional issues the client has noticed, but I'm sure there are some they haven't found yet.

- the menu doesn't open on click
- the back to top button shows all the time
- the form can submit even when the inputs are empty
- there are a variety of performance issues
	- images are not optimized for mobile
	- scrolling is a bit jumpy and sluggish

Just from glancing at the code, I can see quite a few standards issues along with accessibility issues. The CSS could also be implemented more efficiently with less specificity by utilizing classes along with being more consistent.
